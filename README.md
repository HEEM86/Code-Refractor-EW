Ernest's Code Refractor Readme. 

This is a detailed description that will outline the first project of this BootCamp. The project is a code refractor operation, which a client wanted me to make his code more appropriate in regards to Semantic HTML. The timeline for this project is 1 week, and I will go in and make necessary changes to the client's code through my extensive experience from the UC Berkeley Extension Institution and along with my core analytical problem solving skills. In addition I will be referencing information from sources that illustrate the correct practices for refractoring HTML. 

After delivering the finshed product the Client will subquently recieve and Invoice that will illustrate hours worked and what was done to complete the project.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via Slack. 


HTML Code REFRACTOR:

On Tues. Sept. 8th I recieved the HTML code from Client. The code was filled with "div" tags and wasn't organized in a way for non-technical professtionals to understand. I provide a snap shot below to illustrate the actual code that I recieved. 

Snap Shot ---- Of original code ------


Refractor Operation:

1. Filter out unecessary div tags for the core sections and replace them with more non-technical friendly tags for any reader to understand


    Header Tags - Used the appropriate "Header" tag to illustrate the header area. 

   --- Insert Image ---

    Main Tags - Used main tags to reveal the main content of the page. 
    
    --- Insert Image ---
    
    Article Tags - Used these tags to identify the article or the space with important content 

    --- Insert Image ---

    Aside Tags - I used these tags to associate key content on the side that supplemented the main content

    --- Insert Image ---


    Added the image file to the HTML and removed it from the CSS. Just for a cleaner look.

Illustration of these sections with descriptive tags in general is very helpful especially for developers so they know exactly where to go if they need to make changes. There are debug tools that are handy but there not always reliable. Strict project deadlines could result in not implementing descriptive tags, knowing the timeframe is important so the developer can create a plan to make all the necessary changes to meet the clients standards. 



2. Make changes to CSS the coressponds with the changes with the HTML above. 



    Made the header CSS class communicate with the HTML by removing the periods.

    Removed Background image link and added "object-fit: cover to maintain hero image from stretch


    --- Insert Image ---


    Created 2 aside sections and slacked out the other sections to consoladated the code

    The goal is to consolidate the CSS as much as possible. There were sevaral areas of redudancy, where I created 1 class that reflected large sections of the HTML code. From an aesthetic perspecitive I think this is a good practice for being able to go back and quickly understand what parts of the HTML and CSS are communicating.
